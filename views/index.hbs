    <h2>Hello there</h2>
    <p>Theresa's Sound World is powerful way of manipulating audio in the browser in a quick and friendly manner. Built on top of the Web Audio API, it uses a modular routing system allowing you to make sophisticated audio applications and instruments. It also provides a great way of making music using JavaScript. Check out the examples below!</p>

    <h2>Try it out</h2>

    <h3>Create your Sound World</h3>
    <p>All you need to do to have your very own Sound World is to download and include <a href="/download">tsw.js</a> in your HTML document. From this point on all you need to do is use the variable "tsw" to make audio magic.</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">tsw // Your Sound World</pre>

    <h3>Play an audio file</h3>
    <p>Easy! Now let's load a couple of audio files and play one of them once it's ready.</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">tsw.load(
    {
        talking: 'talking.mp3',
        singing: 'singing.mp3'
    },
    function (files) {
        files.talking.play();
    }
);
</pre>
    <p>Let's hear it - <button>Play</button></p>

    <h3>Flip it and reverse it</h3>
    <p>Something something...</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">files.talking.reverse().play();</pre>

    <h3>Dr. Phaser Crane</h3>
    <p>Add some dalek to your diet.</p>
    <pre>files.talking.addPhaser().play();</pre>

    <h3>Link to the Past</h3>
    <pre>mySoundWorld.connect(myPhaser, myDistortion, myReverb);</pre>

    <h3>And much more...</h3>
